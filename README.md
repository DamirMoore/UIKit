UIKit Experimentation

I modify and add functionality to UIKit.

Changes:
1. Get rid of all the text-transform:uppercase css rules. Having all uppercase words is usually bad UX design practice.
2. Added better default colors to choose from.


Upcomming Changes:
1. Add more button colors, sizes, and shapes.
2. Add a full width mega dropdown menu.
3. Add components that allow you to easily and quickly create dashboards.
